## DiscAdmin

DiscAdmin is a physical media management application. I wrote this during my undergrad to help me
organize my CD and DVD collection. It's basically record keeping for my CD cases and everything inside.
It was also an excuse to teach myself SQLite.

Written in C# using WinForms, .NET 3.5 and SQLite. Demo:
